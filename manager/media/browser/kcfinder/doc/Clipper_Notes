KCFinder's documentation is available in Engilsh at http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/.

Temus' integration affects following files:
- browser.php and browser.html were added for MODx integration;
- config.php changed;
- autoload.php - added some code to provide better security in MODx integration; [now in clipper_integration.inc.php]
- helper_httpCache.php - bug fixed.

Further integration for the Clipper manager language affects:
- autoload.php
- clipper_integration.inc.php - code to fake the language parameter in the query string as passed by browser.html and browser.php
			(a bit hacky, but seems the best option to minimise upgrade issues).
