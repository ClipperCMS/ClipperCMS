KCFinder's documentation is available in Engilsh at http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/.

Temus' integration for MODx affects following files:
	- browser.php and browser.html were added for MODx integration;
	- config.php changed;
	- core/autoload.php - added some code to provide better security in MODx integration;
		[now in clipper_integration.inc.php]
	- lib/helper_httpCache.php - bug fixed.

Integration for Clipper affects:
- core/autoload.php
- config.php - now uses system settings
- clipper_integration.inc.php
	- Clipper system settings
	- code to fake the language parameter in the query string as passed by browser.html and browser.php
			(a bit hacky, but seems the best option to minimise upgrade issues).

Further integration for the Clipper affecting kcfinder's core:
- core/browser.php - line 706 to prevent index.html and mcpuk's thumbnails being shown.

Fixes for IE 10 to kcfinder javascript:
	See https://github.com/ClipperCMS/ClipperCMS/commit/b02a4dfa0d77a47cf0d3a6f1728f0d45d64598f4 
	This is also fixed in the kcfinder git repo.
	Future stable versions of kcfinder should not need this fix applying again.
